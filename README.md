## Different Application

- [Tree of Clarifications: Answering Ambiguous Questions with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.63.pdf) `EMNLP2023` using RAG to clarify ambiguous questions

- [Divide and Conquer: Towards Better Embedding-based Retrieval for Recommender Systems from a Multi-task Perspective](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dc4xsFj1SWB1zNVNGp8qqA) :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire: this is very inspiring!

## Datasets

- [FRESHLLMS: REFRESHING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH SEARCH ENGINE AUGMENTATION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03214.pdf)

## Some Problems

### Lost in Middle

1. https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dahnrxGBaNIfEOzruxCbOw useful in practice, similiar with UniMS-RAG, the weights of different sources, the rerank processing for retrieved documents from different sources

### Retrieve or Generateï¼Ÿ

- [Self-DC: When to retrieve and When to generate? Self Divide-and-Conquer for Compositional Unknown Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13514.pdf) :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire: the benchmark and framework both are valuable and important.

- [Blinded by Generated Contexts: How Language Models Merge Generated and Retrieved Contexts for Open-Domain QA?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11911.pdf) :fire: a good paper for analysis, not a method paper

- [Retrieve Only When It Needs: Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10612.pdf)

- [Self-Knowledge Guided Retrieval Augmentation for Large Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.691/)
